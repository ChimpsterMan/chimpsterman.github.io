  "description": "A Scouting app for the robotics team designed for mobile phones. They enter various information about the teams and it is all dumped into a google spreadsheet where the data can be analyzed. It was barebones at the time the base code was written so I'm not sure if I have updated it yet for proper use. Written in HTML, CSS, JS, and Node with the google sheets API.",
