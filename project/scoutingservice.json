  "description": "A Scouting app for the robotics team designed for mobile phones. They enter various information about the teams and it is all dumped into a google spreadsheet where the data can be analysed. It was barebones at the time the base code was written so I'm not sure if I have updated it yet for proper use. Written in html,js,css, and node with the google sheets api.",
