  "description": "A learning project for c++ and SFML. Uses classes and .href files. It is a standard Flappy bird game the player uses Space to flap and fly in between pipes. It started as a project to use glider physics and would be very over-complicated for fun. But sadly that was very hard so you can see the remnants of my attempts commented in the code.",
