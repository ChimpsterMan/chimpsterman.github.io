  "description": "A learning project for c++ and sfml. Uses classes and .href files. It is a standard Flappy bird game the player uses Space to flap and fly inbetween pipes. It started out as a project to use glider physics and be a very over complicated flappy bird game for fun. But sadly that was very hard so you can see the reminants of my attempts commented in the code.",
